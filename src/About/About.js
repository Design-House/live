                                        <p>Human-centered design is a problem-solving approach that puts people at the center of the design process. It involves understanding the needs, wants, and behaviors of the people who will use or interact with the product, service, or system being designed.</p>

                                        <p>Human-centered design involves several stages, including research, ideation, prototyping, and testing. During the research phase, designers gather insights about the users and their needs through methods such as interviews, surveys, and observation.</p>

                                        <p>During the ideation phase, designers brainstorm and generate ideas that address the needs and insights gathered during the research phase. The prototyping phase involves creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes to test and refine the ideas. Finally, during the testing phase, designers gather feedback from users and iterate on the design to improve its usability and effectiveness.</p>

                                        <p><b>A/B testing:</b> Conducting A/B testing to compare two different versions of a design and determine which performs better with users.</p>

                                        <p><b>Expert reviews:</b> Seeking feedback and input from experts in UX design, information architecture, and other related fields.</p>

                                            <p>Traditional UX practice follows a structured approach to user experience design, involving thorough research, documentation, and usability testing. It begins with user research and requirement gathering, followed by tasks such as information architecture, wireframing, and visual design. Usability testing and iterative design are crucial for refining the user experience. Comprehensive documentation and collaboration ensure effective communication. While conventional UX practice can be linear and time-consuming, it provides a solid foundation for design decisions. Newer approaches like Lean UX and Agile UX offer more flexibility, but conventional UX practice remains valuable for its structured and comprehensive approach to delivering effective user experiences.</p>

                                            <p>Lean UX practice is an iterative and collaborative approach to user experience design. It focuses on delivering value quickly and efficiently by incorporating principles from Lean Startup and Agile methodologies. Lean UX emphasizes cross-functional collaboration, rapid prototyping, and continuous iteration based on user feedback. It promotes a shift from heavy documentation to a more streamlined and flexible process, prioritizing actionable insights and quick validation of design assumptions. The goal of Lean UX is to create user-centric designs while minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency in the design and development process.</p>
