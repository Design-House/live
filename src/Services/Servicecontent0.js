            <h4>The UX consulting process typically involves the following steps:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Understanding the business goals and user needs:</b> We start by understanding the business objectives, target audience, and user needs. This involves conducting user research, analysing data, and defining user personas.</li>
              <li><b>Assessing the current user experience:</b> We evaluate the existing user experience to identify areas of improvement. This involves reviewing the product’s usability, user interface, content, and functionality.</li>
              <li><b>Providing recommendations:</b> Based on our findings, we provide recommendations and solutions that align with the business goals and user needs. These recommendations may include changes to the user interface, information architecture, content strategy, or overall design approach.</li>
              <li><b>Prototyping and testing:</b> We create prototypes and conduct user testing to validate the recommended solutions and ensure that they meet the needs of the target audience.</li>
              <li><b>Implementation:</b> Once the recommendations have been validated, we work with the business to implement the changes and optimise the user experience.</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Design thinking consulting</h4>
          <p>A problem related to a product or service has to be addressed in 3 angles; business, people and technical. In this business and technical aspects may not require explanation, as it is popular. However the people angle is comparatively less discussed, however it’s very crucial in the success of a product or service(be it internal or external). The people here means the target audience, or the actual users of the product or service. Even stakeholders are not aware of all the challenges and difficulties experienced by the people in actual context of use. Experienced design thinking consultants use proven methods to understand and empathise with the target audience, this  helps the business and technical experts refine the solution, by prioritising the needs, and have a balanced view on the solution.</p>

        <div className='headplus-content mt-5'>
          <h4>How it works</h4>
          <p>The design thinking consultant works closely with the business analyst and the technical architect. In the discovery phase the three perspectives are used to analyse the problem to ensure a balanced and optimised solution that solves the right problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div className='headplus-content mt-5'>
          <h4>Why design thinking consultants?</h4>
          <p>Including design thinking consultants in the discovery phase will reduce effort and time to find the right solution for the context of use. They are experts in applying research methodologies to collect data and analyse it in a meaningful way. They can identify the business and technical biases that may affect user experience adversely.</p>
          <p>In requirement gathering phase design thinking consultant from UX team acts as user advocate and thinks from user’s perspective. This fills the gaps in business and technical views. So inclusion  of design thinking consultants since the requirement gathering phase itself is crucial in finding the right solution that will be really solving the user’s problem.</p>
