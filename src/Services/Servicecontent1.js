        <p>One example of the importance of UX in automation is in self-driving cars. The design of the car’s interface, such as the dashboard and touchscreen, can significantly affect how users interact with the car’s automated features. For example, a poorly designed interface that is difficult to understand or use could lead to confusion and frustration for the driver, making it less likely that they will use the car’s automated features.</p>
        <p>Another example is in chatbots, which are becoming increasingly popular in customer service. A well-designed chatbot can provide a seamless and efficient customer service experience, while a poorly designed one can frustrate and annoy users.</p>
        <p>Another example UX for a recruitment and onboarding platform will help several user groups(candidates, new joiners, HR and operations team etc) to have an easy and effective interaction with the system.</p>
