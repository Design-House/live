<h4>Content audit</h4>
    <p>A content audit is a systematic review of an organization’s content assets, encompassing a wide range of materials such as articles, videos, and
reports. This evaluation is conducted through the lens of a content and communication framework, assessing factors like relevance, accuracy,
consistency, and performance. The benefits of a content audit are manifold; it helps align content with evolving organizational goals, ensures
accuracy and credibility, maintains brand consistency, and enhances user experience. Furthermore, it identifies opportunities for SEO optimization,
confirms legal and regulatory compliance, and informs data-driven decision-making. Ultimately, a well-executed content audit empowers
organisations to optimise their content strategy, reduce costs, and improve the return on investment while staying competitive in the ever-changing
communication landscape.</p>
<h4>Storyboard</h4>
<p>A storyboard is a visual representation of a story or narrative, typically used in the fields of filmmaking, animation, advertising, and design. It
consists of a series of illustrated or sketched frames or panels that depict the key scenes or moments in a story, presented in chronological order.
Storyboards are a crucial tool for planning and communicating the visual aspects of a project, helping creators visualize how a story will unfold
before it’s brought to life.</p>
<p>Storyboards are not limited to film and animation; they are also used in various other creative and design disciplines, such as advertising, web
design, and even comic book creation. In essence, a storyboard serves as a blueprint for storytelling and visual communication, helping creators
bring their ideas to life in a structured and cohesive manner.</p>
