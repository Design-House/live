            <h5 className="mb-3">Why ESG?</h5>
                <p >As a UX team, we believe in the value of continuous improvement. We actively sought feedback from users and stakeholders, conducted usability tests, and analyzed user data to identify areas for enhancement. By collaborating with NGOs, charity homes, contributors, buyers, and retail store owners, we gained invaluable insights that informed iterative improvements to both The Humane Life and The Humane Shop platforms. Our vision was to transform these platforms into a comprehensive and user-centric hub for all non-profit activities, continually adapting to meet the evolving needs of users and the society they served.
                </p>
                <p>Widespread problems like deforestation, pollution, and climate change are the result of this.Carbon emissions, labor standards, diversity and inclusion policies, and corporate governance procedures are a few examples of ESG factors.However, the dangers of lacking sustainability are not limited to individuals.</p>
                <p>Many organisations also pose significant risks to the environment and society. Some companies prioritise profit over sustainability, leading to practices such as resource depletion, exploitation of labor, and environmental degradation. Due to the lack of accountability and transparency, it  exacerbates the dangers posed by unsustainable practices.</p>

            <div className="journal-content mt-5">
            <h5 className="mt-5">Our approach</h5>
            <p >On taking into account all the things, we decided to devise a framework that helps stakeholders to understand how an organisation manages risks and opportunities related to environmental, social, and governance.As it is a new product, we consulted with the subject matter experts for guidance and went through the literature review to get a better clarity..We identified three user personas: Vendors,Employees and ESG team .We have taken into account many of the ESG metrics that include greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, waste water, energy use, waste generation, employee safety record, and community impact.</p>
            <p>We worked closely and analysed the ESG guidelines to understand their goals and targets, as well as the target audience. We created a set of design guidelines for the ESG framework, incorporating elements such as a sustainability dashboard, a carbon footprint calculator, and social impact reports.We organised design workshops and did usability testing for the initial prototypes done..We put our all efforts in gamifying the platform to keep the users interested in initiating a new idea or volunteering for any programme.</p>
            <h5 className="mt-5">Outcome</h5>
            <p >Our work accurately reflected the corporation’s ESG goals and targets and achieved in communicating complex information and promoting sustainability and corporate social responsibility practices.And more importantly it keeps the people engaged and involves maximum number of participation.</p>

            <h5 mt-5>Concusion</h5>
            <p mt-3>It is important to recognize that sustainable practices are not only necessary for the health and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants, but also for long-term economic stability and prosperity. By prioritizing sustainability and holding both individuals and corporations accountable for their actions, we can work towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all.</p>
