                <h5 className="mb-5">First impression is the best impression” it’s  not just a saying, but a psychological fact in the case of people’s experience with a service, product or organization, and hence it is important in employee onboarding experience.</h5>
                   
                    
                <p className="mt-3">If this is the case of new joiners the experience of the people who conduct the onboarding activity is equally important. Because the first group’s experience depends on the second group’s approach.</p>
                <p className="mt-3">Even though the recruitment and onboarding process are almost the same in all IT organisations, the experience of people involved in the process varies, organization to organisation. So in order to understand it in the specific context each organisation has to conduct research, to discover pros and cons of the particular organisation’s recruitment and onboarding process. This research report is the first version of such a study conducted among Vuramites. The study was planned in line with the organisation’s goal of “ 100% satisfaction for vuramites”.  The purpose is to identify improvement areas of onboarding experience and recommend solutions in a People Centered Design perspective.</p>
                <p className="mt-3">In this exploratory surveys and interviews were used to understand the current situation. Communication, process, system, nature of work and culture were the main focus areas.</p>

            <h4 className='mt-5'>Challenges</h4>
            <p>Understanding the current experience of new joiners is a challange, as they are new to the organisation and mostly won’t express actual feelings, if it’s negative. </p>
            <h4 className='mt-5'>Methods</h4>
            <p>As this is an exploratory study to identify problem areas, a mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. In this more importance is given to qualitative studies, as its prime to understand “why” a particular problem exists. The surveys were conducted with the new joiners and interviews were conducted with the operations team and recruitment panelists. </p>

            <h4 className='mt-5'>Overview of an employee’s journey</h4>
            <p>An employee’s(future employee) ‘experience’(with a company) starts from the moment he/she hears about the organisation or see a job description. So to achieve 100% satisfaction for Vuramites, we have to take care from the recruitment phase itself. (Think the value 100% is realistic, because satisfaction depends on internal and external factors).</p>
            <p>The organisation has to give realistic picture of its culture and type of work to the candidates. This will help them take right decision. Each interface, be it human or computer, it should reflect the culture, it should convey, its an automation company.</p>

                <p>Various biases interfere with the selection process. So the recruitment team should be aware of these biases(linguistic, racial, regional etc. The primary goal is quality and efficiency of the work. So it’s recommended to focus on experience and work quality more.)</p>

They are professional, personal and cultural aspects. Understanding behavioural aspects from existing literature can give theoretical support to our findings. So we examined several such studies and articles and could find widely reported challenges and possible solutions. However it was important for us to understand specific problems in our context. So started with surveys, interviews were conducted with people from all the relevant groups.</p>

              <li>Interviewed 21 selected people from the operations.</li>
              <li>Stratified systematic sampling to ensure representation from all team who is directly or indirectly involved in recruitment and onboarding.</li>
              <li>Qualitative in nature, to understand the current situation deeply, and identify problem areas.</li>
              <li>The inquiry was mainly on how they work, nature of work, pain points, expectations.</li>
              
            </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>The onboarding process, to the new joiners, gives new experience, at the same time it gives a repetitive experience to the people who conduct it. The main aspects of the process, from an experience perspective,  involve planning, content, communication and presentation. From the survey more than 80% of the new joiners found the experience was excellent/good. This view is from freshers. However this may change in the case of experienced people, there were not many experienced people to get reliable data in that group. So more interviews have to be conducted. Even when most of the people find it good as the participants are freshers and due to cultural reasons response bias in such a survey can be high. However, even from 10% (5/50) responses pointing to specific problems has to be addressed. The highlight was information overload in induction, a 3 day induction is stuffed with a lot of information. This can be avoided by sharing the content on a digital platform. This can reduce time for induction and utilize the time for more interactive sessions and doubt clearance. Even after several levels of interviews and information packed induction about 34% of the people didn’t know the kind of work they were going to do at Vuram, more than 60% said they know, however we need to consider the response bias so the actual number of people with lack of clarity could be more.</p>
            <p>At the same time the problems faced by the people who are involved directly or indirectly in  conducting the  onboarding process are, multi tasking, manual work, inefficient communication media(for the particular context), issues in planning, organizing. In interviews several people raised the need for automation of process, its very evident that the recruitment and onboarding process can be more effective with automation The current rejection rate(~50%), could be reduced if automation is used in preliminary screening, considering the situation mentioned by some participants; to meet target in screening stage wrong candidates are also shortlisted, this increases the rate of rejection and high attrition. Automation need not be done at one go however with a holistic picture of how it will work connecting all the teams in operations required at design stage. Implementation can be done as modules.</p>
            <h4 className='mt-5'>Analysis</h4>
            <p>A service blueprint was created, which gave a big picture of the whole journey from a new joiner’s view, timeline, important touch points, who all are involved, technologies, front and back stage interactions were captured,this gave insight to the challenges and possible solutions.</p>

            <h4 className='mt-5'>Solution</h4>
            <p>The solution suggested comprises improvements in multiple areas. The recommended to start with recruitment and onboarding activities. Because it gives the first impression to the employees. The improvement starts from publishing job descriptions and advertisements. Bringing a realistic picture of the organisation, culture and nature of the job is important to get suitable candidates who really like what he reads from the descriptions. Identified and provided improvements in recruitment and onboarding activities by optimising the processes. Bringing an integrated and automated digital platform for recruitment, onboarding and further interaction reduces repetition of several activities and thus reduces effort of the people team.</p>
            <p>Digital platform to host repeating contents, use of WBTs and videos for self paced learning major suggestions.</p>
